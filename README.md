# Simple Banking App

## Overview

The Simple Banking App is a basic backend API built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL for managing customer data and transactions. It provides CRUD operations for customers, along with deposit and withdrawal transactions. Each transaction includes a unique identifier and a timestamp, making it suitable for professional use.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for customer data.
- **Transaction Handling**: Record and retrieve deposit and withdrawal transactions for customers.
- **Transaction Details**: Each transaction includes a unique identifier (transaction ID) and a timestamp for tracking and auditing.

## Technologies Used

- Java Spring Boot
- MySQL Database
- Spring Data JPA for database interaction

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the MySQL database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
3. Run the application using your preferred IDE or build tools.
4. Explore the API using tools like Postman or Swagger UI.

## Endpoints

- `/api/customers`: CRUD operations for managing customers.
- `/api/transactions`: Record and retrieve deposit and withdrawal transactions.

## Disclaimer

This is a simplified example for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, additional features such as authentication, authorization, and error handling should be implemented for security and robustness.
